## Track and Problem Statement 🚧

* Open Innovation
* Hack for Good

## Background 📖

Our project starts from the TATA steel plant situated in Jharkhand. Every once in a while there are disturbing reports in the local daily. It details people working in the blast furnace who got injured or under worse circumstances even died. This loss of human life is devastating. The sad part of all of this is the fact that this has been going on for decades together. <br/>

To combat this, there have been wearable equipment available for the workers. But even then, the hazard exists. <br/>

Our proposed solution, is to use Industry 4.0 technology robots to carry out the 2 tasks that a human was supposed to carry out in the blast furnace, and to achieve it with minimal production cost.
